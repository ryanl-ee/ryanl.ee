> You like D&D, Audrey Hepburn, Fangoria, Harry Houdini, and croquet. You can't swim, you can't dance, and you don't know karate. Face it, you're never gonna make it.

It's a damn fun album. You people remember fun, right?

Favorite tracks: **Helena**, To the End, **I'm Not Okay (I Promise)**, Thank You for the Venom
